Write a C++ program using structures to store and process student information.
Define a structure Student containing data members — name (string) and marks (integer).
Input the number of students n. For each student, read their name and marks in three subjects, calculate their total marks and average, and display them.
Finally, determine and print the name of the student who scored the highest total marks (topper) along with their total marks.


#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

struct Student {
    int n;
    string name;     // changed int → string (for names)
    int marks;       // kept same (you used marks in a loop)
};                   // added missing semicolon

int main() {
    struct Student s1;
    int i, j;
    int sum = 0;
    int avg;
    int maxTotal = 0;
    string topper;

    cout << "Enter n: ";
    cin >> s1.n;

    for(i = 1; i <= s1.n; i++) {
        cin.ignore(); // to clear buffer before getline
        cout << "Enter Name: ";
        getline(cin, s1.name);

        sum = 0; // reset sum for each student

        cout << "Enter 3 marks: ";
        for(j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
            cin >> s1.marks;
            sum = sum + s1.marks;
        }

        avg = sum / 3;
        cout << "Total = " << sum << ", Average = " << avg << endl;

        if(sum > maxTotal) {
            maxTotal = sum;
            topper = s1.name;
        }
    }

    cout << "\nTopper is: " << topper << " with total marks = " << maxTotal;
    return 0;
}

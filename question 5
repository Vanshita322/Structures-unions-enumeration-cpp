#include<iostream>
Write a C++ program using structures to store and check a student’s marks.Define a structure Student containing:
name → string to store student’s name
marks → array or collection to store marks in multiple subjects
Input the name of the student and the marks in all subjects.
Check if the student has passed all subjects:
A student passes a subject if marks in that subject are greater than or equal to 40.
A student fails if any subject has marks less than 40.
Print "Pass" if the student passes all subjects, else print "Fail".


#include<string>
using namespace std;
struct Student {
    int n;
    string name;
    int marks;
};
int main() {
    struct Student s;
    cout<<"Enter the name of the student : ";
    getline(cin,s.name);
    cout<<"Enter the marks of the student : ";
    cin >>s.n;
    int i;
    int count = 0;
    for(i=1;i<=s.n;i++) {
        cin>>s.marks;
        if(s.marks >= 40) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    if(count >= 3) {
        cout<<"Pass";
    }
    else {
        cout<<"Fail";
    }
    return 0;
}

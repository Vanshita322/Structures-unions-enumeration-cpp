Write a C++ program using structures to represent complex numbers.

Define a structure Complex with two members: real (integer) and imaginary (integer).

Implement two functions inside the structure:

add() → takes another complex number as input and returns a new Complex structure representing the sum.

subtract() → takes another complex number as input and returns a new Complex structure representing the difference.

Implement a function display() to print a complex number in the format a+bi.

In main(), read two complex numbers from the user (real and imaginary parts separately), calculate their sum and difference using the structure functions, and display the results.


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
struct Complex {
    int real;
    int imaginary;
    Complex add(Complex c) {
        Complex result;
        result.real = real + c.real;
        result.imaginary = imaginary + c.imaginary;
        return result;
    }
    Complex substract(Complex c) {
        Complex result;
        result.real = real - c.real;
        result.imaginary = imaginary - c.imaginary;
        return result;
    }
    void display() {
        cout<<real<<"+"<<imaginary<<"i"<<endl;
    }
};
int main() {
  struct Complex c1,c2,sum,diff;
  cout<<"Enter first complex number : ";
  cin>>c1.real>>c1.imaginary;
  cout<<"Enter second complex number : ";
  cin>>c2.real>>c2.imaginary;
  sum = c1.add(c2);
  diff = c1.substract(c2);
  cout<<"Required Sum is : ";
  sum.display();
  cout<<"Required Substraction is : ";
  diff.display();
  return 0;
}
